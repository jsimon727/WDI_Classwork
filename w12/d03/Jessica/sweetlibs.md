# Sweet Lib Day!

### Objectives

1. Practice learning a new technology outside the scope of a structured lesson
2. Gain exposure to new technologies that are out there

### Requirements

1. What problem does it solve? How does it do it (conceptually)?

-lightweight and quick 
-Real time updates from multiple users
-Input/Output calls more efficient 
-Asynchronous, non-blocking allows efficiency 



 Express.js, a Sinatra-inspired web development framework for Node.js, and the de-facto standard for the majority of Node.js applications out there today.

socket.io and sockjs - Server-side component of the two most common websockets components out there today.


Input/Output calls more efficient, lightweight nature allows for maximum configuration

nonblocking, event-driven asynchronous nature

Node makes the call to the database, then continues processing whatever may be next on the call stack

server side 

express similar to sinatra, minimal, flexible

. Why would I use it? What are the alternatives?

gives me the ability to write back-end code in one of my favorite languages: JavaScript.

You definitely don’t want to use Node.js for CPU-intensive operations; in fact, using it for heavy computation will annul nearly all of its advantages. Where Node really shines is in building fast, scalable network applications, as it’s capable of handling a huge number of simultaneous connections with high throughput, which equates to high scalability.

real-time, two-way connections

Rails, Sinatra
AJAX
fast scabale network applications
huge number of simutaneous connection

a tool for working in the non-blocking, event-driven I/O paradigm.

two way connected

don't use when have a high computational

express  
socket.io

are like gems for node

it’s possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded

Using Node.js with a relational database is still quite a pain (see below for more detail). Do yourself a favour and pick up any other environment like Rails, Django, or ASP.Net MVC if you’re trying to perform relational operations.

### To Do

1. Get it installed
2. Build something small with it


lightweight
more configuration less convention

This allowed him to define a convention of non-blocking, event-driven I/O
